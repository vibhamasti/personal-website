:::{#vibha-masti-header}

Hi there :wave:! I'm a senior undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering student at PES University, Bangalore. I am currently interning at Apple as a Machine Learning Engnieer.

My research interests lie in machine learning, natural language processing, and related fields. I have experience interning at Apple, Goldman Sachs, [Netradyne](https://www.netradyne.com/), and [Vogo](https://vogo.in/). I have also worked on research projects in NLP, ML, Graph ML, Music IR, etc. You can find my detailed CV [here](resumes/VibhaMasti_CV.pdf).

I enjoy making concise, pictorial and aesthetically-pleasing lecture notes that my peers at college have been using to study since my first year (~38,000+ hits to the [link](https://bit.ly/pesu-btech-resources)). This really helped my juniors and peers during the pandemic as it was very difficult for everyone to keep up with all the online classes during such difficult times. 

I learn to play the South-Indian instrument Saraswathi Veena in the Carnatic style. I also enjoy making YouTube videos about my experiences and interests. I have made videos about my college life, academic conferences, and more. You can find my YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/@VibhaMasti).
