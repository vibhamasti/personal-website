:::{#vibha-masti-header}

Hi there :wave:! I am a Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) student at the Language Technologies Institute of Carnegie Mellon University. I did my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at PES University, Bangalore.

My primary focus is applied machine learning/research engineering. My research interests lie in natural language generation and understanding, music generation, code generation, and graph-based learning. You can find my publications [here](pubs.qmd). I have also worked as an intern at Apple, Goldman Sachs, Netradyne, and Vogo. You can find my resume [here](resumes/Resume_VibhaMasti.pdf).

I believe in the power of visual storytelling and teaching. I enjoy making aesthetically-pleasing lecture notes that my peers at college (PES University) have been using to study. I was awarded by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for my immense contributions through these notes. You can check out my notes [here](notes.qmd). 

I learn to play the South-Indian instrument Saraswathi Veena in the Carnatic style. I also enjoy making YouTube videos about my experiences and interests. I have made videos about my college life, academic conferences, and more. You can find my YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/@VibhaMasti).
