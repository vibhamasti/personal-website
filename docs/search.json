I‚Äôm a senior undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering student at PES University, Bangalore. I learn to play the South-Indian instrument Saraswathi Veena in the Carnatic style.\nMy research interests lie in machine learning and related fields. I have worked on projects in the domains of data analytics, graph machine learning, semi-supervised learning, NLP and Music Information Retrieval. I also have experience interning at Apple, Goldman Sachs, Netradyne, and Vogo. My work has ranged from software engineering and backend engineering to NLP and data engineering. You can find my detailed CV here.\nI enjoy making concise, pictorial and aesthetically-pleasing lecture notes that my peers at college have been using to study since my first year (~38,000+ hits to the link). This really helped my juniors and peers during the pandemic as it was very difficult for everyone to keep up with all the online classes during such difficult times.\nI‚Äôm looking for an opportunity where I can utilize my proven academic and creative capabilities along with my previous internship experience to contribute to exciting projects!"
