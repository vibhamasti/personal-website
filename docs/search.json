I‚Äôm a senior undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering student at PES University, Bangalore. I am currently interning at Apple as a Machine Learning Engnieer.\nMy research interests lie in machine learning, natural language processing, and related fields. I have experience interning at Apple, Goldman Sachs, Netradyne, and Vogo. I have also worked on research projects in NLP, ML, Graph ML, Music IR, etc. You can find my detailed CV here.\nI enjoy making concise, pictorial and aesthetically-pleasing lecture notes that my peers at college have been using to study since my first year (~38,000+ hits to the link). This really helped my juniors and peers during the pandemic as it was very difficult for everyone to keep up with all the online classes during such difficult times.\nI learn to play the South-Indian instrument Saraswathi Veena in the Carnatic style. I also enjoy making YouTube videos about my experiences and interests. I have made videos about my college life, academic conferences, and more. You can find my YouTube channel here."
